**EMAIL**

The solution complements the standard email with the display of the recipient field in the copy email, blind copy email, and sent email messages.

Fields for copy and blind copy email have been added to the company data, allowing you to set default email addresses where the copy/blind copy will go when sending an email from Business Central.

The copy/blind copy sending setting is document-based. To set it up, search for Report Selection and choose the appropriate module report selection.

In the window that opens, select the Usage field after the document for which the copy/blind copy field must also be sent when emailing, and check the box for the corresponding setting.

The Sent Emails list shows the Send To field to see who the email was sent to without opening the sent email message.

A setting has been added to Sales & Receivables Setup that allows you to set whether the delivery note is automatically attached to the email when emailing the sales invoice or not.
