The general logic applies that if an option is selected on the vendor or customer card, it only applies to the given vendor's or customer's documents and also does not depend on what is specified in the purchase or sales configuration.

For all the selections, the logic is that the first match found in the sequence is used. For example: Barcode/Vendor/Item.

![][16]

For such a purchase order, the barcode reference number found in the "Item Reference List" table is used for document printouts. If this value was not found in the table, then the vendor code associated with the item would have been searched, and if it had not been found, then the item number specified on the item would have been used. If none of these searches yield a result, then the BC standard value is used.

If this value was not found in the table, then the barcode related to the item would have been searched, and if it had not been found, then the item code without specifying field "Reference type" would have been searched in the table. If none of these searches yield a result, then the BC standard value is used.
